NAME

**einksysstat.conf** â€” Display system stats on an eInk display


DESCRIPTION
===========

This is the format of a file used with the einksysstat(1) command.

Displays a series of system stats on an eInk paper screen attached to e.g. a Rasberry Pi.
This particular implementation is restricted to: 1.54inch e-Paper Module(B) V2 from e.g. Waveshare.
The interface is similar to other boards in the line and other Manufacturers/OEM will no
doubt offer similar boards.

Syntax:
------

The syntax is quite lax. Any text following a hash sign (\#) is discarded (comments)
Where commas (,) and semi-colons (;) are used they may typically be missed out, iff the
meaning is unambigious. 

Strings may quoted using double quotes (") or single quotes (') single quotes
inside double quotes have no special meaning and vice versa. If you need to
include a single quote in a single quoted string it needs to be escaped with a
backslash (\\)  (and similar for double quotes).

Whitespace can be spaces and or tabs.

The input is a series of **lines** each line  defines an **action** the action 
is described by a **verb** followed by arguments . The verb may be in upper or
lower base (but not mixed) and the parentheses  are optional, thus:

action (arg1, arg2)

ACTION arg1 arg2

Are equivalent. The reason is the style can look like "text" or CPP Macros, the
latter can actually be embedded in the code and avoid the need to parse files at
runtime. HOWTO is out of scope for this man page (but in git use the tag ironman
and look at woodenman.c)

Actions:

**INIT**       (  < colour >,  < rotate > ); 

**HOSTNAME**   (  < xstart >,  < ystart >,  < fsize >  ); 

**TIMESTAMP**  (  < xstart >,  < ystart >,  < fsize >  ); 

**UPTIME**     (  < xstart >,  < ystart >,  < fsize >  ); 

**RENDER**     ();

**SLEEP**      (  < seconds > );

**CLEAR**      ();

**LOOP**       ();

**DF**         (            < ystart >, < fsize >, < device >, < label >  < df >  ,< cutoff > );

**AGE**        (  < xstart >, < ystart >, < fsize >, < filename >   ,< label >  < units >  ,< cutoff > );

**FILE**       (  < xstart >, < ystart >, < fsize >, < filename >   ,< lines > );

**METER**      (  < xstart >, < ystart >, < fsize >, < value >,  < colour > );

**TEXT**       (  < xstart >, < ystart >, < fsize >, < text >,  < colour > );

Where:

colour:= is\_black\_on\_grey | is\_red\_on\_grey | is\_black\_on\_red | is\_red\_on\_black

df:=   df\_meg | df\_geg | df\_gig | df\_best | df\_pcent | 
	    meg | geg | gig | best | pcent |
        MB | GB |
        M | G

units:= age\_minutes | age\_hours | age\_days | minutes | hours | days

rotate:= 0 | 90 | 180 | 270

xstart:=column to start drawing 0-199

ystart:=row to start drawing 0-199

fsize:=8 | 12 | 16 | 20 | 24 (font size )

seconds:= < int > 

device:=< string >  (a pathname ... actually to a file, not a /dev type devce)

label:=< string > (a short display label)

cutoff:=< int >

lines:=< int > (a small number e.g. 1 2 or 3)

Semantics:
---------

**INIT** 
:	Needed at the start to setup the device.
	
**HOSTNAME**
:	Displays the hostname(1) 
	
**TIMESTAMP**
:	Displays the current time of day as "%Y/%m/%d-%H:%M" see strftime(3)
	
**UPTIME**
	Displays uptime(1) in Days+hours+minutes

**RENDER**
:	Actually "paint" the display (takes quite a long time)
	
**SLEEP**
:	Pause for < seconds > , useful if you want multiple "pages" to display
	
**CLEAR**
:	clears the display. Generaly if the device will be stored fro long periods it should be cleared

**LOOP**
:	Not implemented (part of a more complex design where this command runs as a daemon)
	
**DF**
:	Akin to the df(1) command. Output occupies the entire line (so there is no xstart)
	queries the freespace of the file system where the given file (as described by the path < device >)
	< label<  defines the "short name" used to describe it , so /lost&found  and "ROOT" might be
	suitable for < device > and < label > respectively . The display number can be in Megabytes, Gigabytes
	or a percentage. If the free space is below *< cutoff > percent free*, the meter is displayed in red
	otherside it is all in black.
	
**AGE**
:	Check the age of a file < file > and displays it in Days, Hours or Minutes. If the value is older
	than < cutoff > it will be displayed in red, else black. Typical use is a logfile used on a SUCCESSFUL
	backup, if it is older than < cutoff > days that is a red warning.

**FILE**
:	Displays the first < lines > from a < file > . Typicall this file will get updated by other jobs
	e.g. a backup failure message.
	
**METER**
:	This is the naked version of the meter from DF
	
**TEST**
:	Just displays a line of fixed text (might be of use e.g with METER)

 RENDER(), # This takes quite a long time (e.g. 30 seconds)
 SLEEP(5),
 
 CLEAR(), # This clears the display (after 5 second wait above) ...proably not what you want to do
